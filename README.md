# LiveFakeCheck â€“ A Real-Time Framework for Frame-Level Deepfake Detection

A **PyQt5-based application** for testing deepfake detection on live video streams using pretrained model weights.

![LiveFakeCheck](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/875ed71f-0eb4-4c63-aca8-00097e7d11ba)

This application is built on top of the [**Self-Blended Images (SBI)**](https://github.com/mapooon/SelfBlendedImages) method to classify live video frames as real or fake.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

To create a conda environment, run:

```bash
conda create -n lfcenv python=3.9 -y
```

To activate conda environment, run:

```bash
conda activate lfcenv
```

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸš€ Running the Application

1. Download the pretrained model weights provided by the SBI authors [**here**](https://github.com/mapooon/SelfBlendedImages?tab=readme-ov-file#2-pretrained-model).
2. Place the downloaded weights in the `./weights/` directory.
3. Launch the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This framework currently supports frame-level models. Future versions may support optical flowâ€“based or hybrid models.
- Preprocessing sensitivity (e.g., sharpening) significantly impacts detection performance.
